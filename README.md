# Pose Detection with Posenet

Welcome to the Pose Detection with Posenet project, a real-time human pose estimation system using the Posenet model from ML5.js. This project provides a simple example of how to integrate pose detection into your web applications and how to calculate angles between specific body parts.

## Features

- Real-time human pose detection using Posenet.
- Visualization of detected poses with key body joint markers and skeleton lines.
- Calculation of angles between the right hip, right knee, and right ankle.
- Displaying a message when the right hip makes an angle of approximately 180 degrees.

## Getting Started
